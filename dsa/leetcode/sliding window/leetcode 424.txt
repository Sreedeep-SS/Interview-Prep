LC 424 - Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.


Approach:
1. Brute force idea - Try every substring, check if it can be made uniform with ≤ k changes → O(n³). Too slow.
2. Optimize with sliding window:
                Expand a window [left, right].

                Track count of characters inside window.

                The key observation:

                    A window is valid if (window_size - max_frequency) ≤ k.

                If invalid → shrink from left.

Solution:

    Use a hashmap count to track char frequencies.

    Track max_freq = frequency of most common char in window.

    Window valid if (right - left + 1) - max_freq ≤ k.

    Otherwise, shrink left.

    Keep track of max window size.

Code:

from collections import defaultdict

s = "AABABBA"
k = 1
res = 0
left = 0
visited = defaultdict(int)
max_frequency = 0

for right in range(len(s)):
    visited[s[right]]+=1
    max_frequency = max(max_frequency,visited[s[right]])
    
    while ((right-left+1) - max_frequency > k):
        visited[s[left]]-=1
        left+=1
    
    res = max(right-left+1, res)
res(visited)
