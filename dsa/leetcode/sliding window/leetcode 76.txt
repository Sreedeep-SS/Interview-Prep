LC 76. Minimum Window Substring

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
 

 Approach:
 1. Brute Force - Check all substrings → verify if contains t. O(n³). Too slow.
 2. Optimization: sliding window with char counts

                Expand right until window covers all chars of t.

                Shrink from left to make it minimum.

                Keep track of the best window.

Solution:

Use need map for t char counts.

Use window map for current window counts.

Maintain a have vs need_count counter:

need_count = len(need) (unique chars in t)

have = number of chars where window[c] == need[c].

Valid window if have == need_count.

Try to shrink from left while still valid.

Track the smallest valid window.

Code:

from collections import Counter

def minWindow(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    if not s or not t:
        return ""

    need = Counter(t)
    window = {}
    have, need_count = 0, len(need)
    res, res_len = [-1, -1], float("inf")
    left = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        c = s[right]
        window[c] = window.get(c, 0) + 1

        if c in need and window[c] == need[c]:
            have += 1

        # shrink while valid
        while have == need_count:
            # update result
            if (right - left + 1) < res_len:
                res = [left, right]
                res_len = right - left + 1

            # pop from left
            window[s[left]] -= 1
            if s[left] in need and window[s[left]] < need[s[left]]:
                have -= 1
            left += 1

    l, r = res
    return s[l:r+1] if res_len != float("inf") else ""
