LC 225. Implement Stack using Queues

Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyStack class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]

Explanation
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False


Key Idea:

    Stack = LIFO (last in, first out)
    Queue = FIFO (first in, first out)

    We must reverse the order using queues so the last pushed element always comes out first.

Two Approaches:

    Approach 1: Using 2 Queues (Simpler)

        Push: O(1) (just enqueue into q1).

        Pop/Top: O(n) (move all except last element to q2).

        Steps:

        Push into q1.

        For pop: move elements from q1 → q2 until only 1 left. That last one is the “stack top.”

        Swap names of q1 and q2.

    Approach 2: Using 1 Queue (Clever & Better for Interviews 🚀)

        Keep stack property by rotating the queue after every push.

        Push: O(n).

        Pop/Top: O(1).

        Steps:

        Push new element into queue.

        Then rotate the queue (dequeue and enqueue back) until the new element is at the front.
        → This way, the newest element is always on top.

        For pop, just dequeue from the front.


Code:

    from collections import deque
    class MyStack:

        def __init__(self):
            self.q=deque()
            

        def push(self, x: int) -> None:
            self.q.append(x)
            for _ in range(len(self.q)-1):
                self.q.append(self.q.popleft())

        def pop(self) -> int:
            return self.q.popleft()
            

        def top(self) -> int:
            return self.q[0]
            

        def empty(self) -> bool:
            return len(self.q)==0
            


    # Your MyStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
    # obj = MyStack()
    # obj.push(x)
    # param_2 = obj.pop()
    # param_3 = obj.top()
    # param_4 = obj.empty()
