LC 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]


Approaches
1. Brute Force (O(n²))

    Check every pair:

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]

2. Hashmap (Best, O(n))

    Use a dictionary to store numbers we’ve seen and their indices.

        def twoSum(nums, target):
            seen = {}   # number → index
            for i, num in enumerate(nums):
                complement = target - num
                if complement in seen:
                    return [seen[complement], i]
                seen[num] = i

    Why it works?

    As we iterate, for each num, we check if target - num was seen before.

    If yes, we found the pair.

    If no, we store num for future use.


3. Two Pointers (O(n log n) because sorting)

    If array can be sorted (and indices not required):

        nums = [2,7,11,15]
        target = 9

        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1
        while l < r:
            s = nums[l] + nums[r]
            if s == target:
                return [nums[l], nums[r]]
            elif s < target:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1


Key Notes:

    Hashmap approach is the most common (LC #1).

    If the array is sorted, 2-pointers is neat.

    If they ask all unique pairs (not just one) → you’ll use sets or two-pointers carefully.
