LC 74. Search a 2D Matrix

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

 

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return False
    
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        low, high = 0, m * n - 1
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            row, col = mid // n, mid % n
            mid_val = matrix[row][col]
            
            if mid_val == target:
                return True
            elif mid_val < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        
        return False

Complexity

Time: O(log(m*n)) (binary search over all elements).

Space: O(1).

Alternate Approach (2-step search)

Instead of full flattening:

Use binary search on the first column to find the candidate row.

Binary search inside that row.

Complexity: O(log m + log n).
