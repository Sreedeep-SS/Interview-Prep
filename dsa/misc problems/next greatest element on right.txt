Problem:
Given an array nums, for each element find the next greater element on the right.
If no such element exists, put -1

Example:
nums = [4, 5, 2, 10, 8]
Output = [5, 10, 10, -1, -1]


For 4 → next greater is 5

For 5 → next greater is 10

For 2 → next greater is 10

For 10 → none → -1

For 8 → none → -1

Approach: Monotonic Stack (Right → Left)

    We want to process from right to left and use a stack that keeps elements in decreasing order.

    Steps:

        Initialize an empty stack.

        Traverse array from right → left:

        While stack is not empty and stack.top ≤ current element → pop (since they can’t be “next greater” for anyone left).

        If stack empty → answer is -1. Else → stack.top is the next greater.

        Push current element onto stack.

        Reverse result if you’re appending.

Code:
    def nextGreaterElements(nums):
        n = len(nums)
        ans = [-1] * n
        stack = []  # will store elements in decreasing order
        
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            # remove all smaller or equal elements
            while stack and stack[-1] <= nums[i]:
                stack.pop()
            
            # if stack not empty, top is the next greater
            if stack:
                ans[i] = stack[-1]
            
            # push current element
            stack.append(nums[i])
        
        return ans


    print(nextGreaterElements([4, 5, 2, 10, 8]))
    # Output: [5, 10, 10, -1, -1]


Time Complexity:

    Each element pushed/popped at most once → O(n).

    Space: O(n) for stack + result.
